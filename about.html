  “Reports suggest that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan. It is quite possible that the 2019-nCoV jumped from the host species, i.e., bats, to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of the outbreak. It is not yet known how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts,” says Dr Aggarwal.

  The mode of transmission is unclear but available evidence points to human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts through the respiratory route.
